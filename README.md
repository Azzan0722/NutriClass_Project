NutriClass: Food Classification Using Nutritional Data
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
In todayâ€™s health-conscious world, categorizing food based on nutritional attributes is essential for applications in diet planning, health monitoring, and food recommendation systems. This project focuses on developing a multi-class classification model to classify food items using features like calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and sugar.

By completing this project, we aim to build a robust classification system that helps identify food categories accurately and derive insights into the characteristics of each category.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Load and preprocess the food dataset.

Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates.

Apply feature engineering (scaling, dimensionality reduction, encoding).

Train and evaluate multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Compare model performances using appropriate metrics.

ðŸ›  Skills I Learned
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Model Training & Tuning

Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)

Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

ðŸ“‚ Domain
Food and Nutrition / Machine Learning

ðŸ“ˆ Business Use Cases
Smart Dietary Apps: Recommend food based on nutritional balance.

Health Monitoring Tools: Help nutritionists classify food for diet plans.

Food Logging Systems: Automatically classify entries in food tracking apps.

Educational Platforms: Teach about nutrition using AI-based tools.

Grocery/Meal Planning Apps: Suggest alternative foods within the same category.

ðŸ“Š Approach
1. Data Understanding & Exploration
Load dataset and check class distribution.

Visualize samples and identify patterns across food categories.

Check for imbalance and noise in data.

2. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values (imputation or removal).

Remove duplicates and treat outliers.

Normalize/standardize numerical features.

3. Feature Engineering
Apply PCA or feature selection techniques for dimensionality reduction.

Encode target labels (Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding).

4. Model Building
Train and compare the following algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors

Support Vector Machine

XGBoost

Gradient Boosting
